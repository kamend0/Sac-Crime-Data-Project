# Sac-Crime-Data-Project
Exploration of crime data made available through the City of Sacramento's Open Data Portal: https://data.cityofsacramento.org/search?tags=Public%20Safety

The goals of this project are currently the following:
  1. Explore the data: discover trends over the entire time period available; see the effects of the pandemic on crime in the city; and ask and answer any remaining interesting questions about crime in Sacramento that we can answer with this data.
  2. Visualize the data: using Seaborn plots to see numerical trends; and a combination of Folium, Matplotlib, and GeoPandas to see what crime happens where in the City.
  3. Predict future crime: using a machine learning model based on the scrubbed data, find what, where, and when future crime will occur.

See the "Crime Data Exploration" notebook for a "guided tour" of the data (which addresses the first two goal items); and the "CrimeData" directory for the raw data.
